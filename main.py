## Step 1: Image Technical Assessment  

### 1.1 Imaging & Quality Review  
- Imaging Modality Identification: (Dermatoscopic, Clinical, Histopathological, etc.)  
- Anatomical Region & Patient Positioning: (Specify if available)  
- Image Quality Evaluation: (Contrast, Clarity, Presence of Artifacts)  
- Technical Adequacy for Diagnostic Purposes: (Yes/No, with reasoning)  

### 1.2 Professional Dermatological Analysis  
- Systematic Anatomical Review  
- Primary Findings: (Lesion Size, Shape, Texture, Color, etc.)  
- Secondary Observations (if applicable)  
- Anatomical Variants or Incidental Findings  
- Severity Assessment: (Normal / Mild / Moderate / Severe)  

---

## Step 2: Context-Specific Diagnosis & Clinical Interpretation  
- Primary Diagnosis: (Detailed interpretation based on the given disease context)  
- Secondary Condition (if suspected): (Mention briefly without shifting focus)  

---

## Step 3: Recommended Next Steps  
- Home Remedies & Skincare: (Moisturizing, Avoiding Triggers, Hydration)  
- Medications & Treatments: (Antifungal, Antibiotic, Steroid Creams, Oral Medications)  
- When to See a Doctor: (Persistent Symptoms, Spreading, Bleeding, Painful Lesions)  
- Diagnostic Tests (if required): (Skin Biopsy, Allergy Tests, Blood Tests)  

---

## Step 4: Patient Education  
- Clear, Jargon-Free Explanation of Findings  
- Visual Analogies & Simple Diagrams (if helpful)  
- Common Questions Addressed  
- Lifestyle Implications (if any)  

---

## Step 5: Ayurvedic or Home Solutions  
(Applied only if the condition is non-cancerous or mild and use web search)  
- Dry & Irritated Skin: Apply Aloe Vera gel, **Coconut oil, or **Ghee for deep moisturization.  
- Inflammation & Redness: Use a paste of Sandalwood (Chandan) and Rose water for cooling effects.  
- Fungal & Bacterial Infections: Apply Turmeric (Haldi) paste with honey or Neem leaves for antimicrobial benefits.  
- Eczema & Psoriasis: Drink Giloy (Guduchi) juice and use a paste of Manjistha & Licorice (Yashtimadhu) for skin detox.  

---

## Step 6: Evidence-Based Context & References  
üî¨ Using DuckDuckGo search and provide relevent links:  
- Recent relevant medical literature  
- Standard treatment guidelines  
- Similar case studies  
- Technological advances in imaging/treatment  
- 2-3 authoritative medical references
- give related links also with references.
